# Quine-McCluskey-Algorithm
A Quine-McCluskey-Algorithm implementation in Python

This is an algorithm to minimize boolean functions.
I made this solution using Python 2.7 back around the summer of 2018

You need to specify an input file, like the one in this repo. Also you will have to specify your output file name.
e.g. `python main.py infile.txt output.txt`
